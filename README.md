Image Character Display

Overview

This project consists of a Python script that loads images of characters (letters and special symbols) from a specified folder and displays images corresponding to the characters in a given name. The images are mapped to characters based on filenames, which should represent numbers.

Features

 • Load Images: Loads images from a folder where filenames are numbers corresponding to characters (A=1, B=2, …, Z=26, dot, and space).
 • Create Image Dictionary: Maps characters to their corresponding images based on filenames.
 • Display Name Images: Shows images of characters that make up a given name.

Requirements

 • Python: The script requires Python to be installed.
 • OpenCV: For image processing. Install it via pip:

pip install opencv-python


 • Matplotlib: For displaying images. Install it via pip:

pip install matplotlib



Usage

 1. Prepare Images: Place your images in a folder. The filenames should be numbers representing characters (e.g., 1.jpg for A, 2.jpg for B, etc.). Special characters like dot and space should also be included.
 2. Run the Script: Execute the script using Python:

python script_name.py


 3. Enter Folder Path: When prompted, enter the path to the folder containing the images.
 4. Enter Name: Input the name you want to display. The script will show the corresponding images for each character in the name.

Code Description

 • get_char_for_number(number): Converts a number to a character using a predefined list. Numbers map to letters A-Z, dot, and space.
 • create_image_dictionary(folder_path): Creates a dictionary mapping characters to their corresponding images based on the folder’s contents.
 • display_name_images(image_dict, name): Displays images corresponding to the characters in the given name.

Customization

 • Image Formats: The script currently supports .jpg and .png formats. You can modify the script to include other formats if needed.
 • Character Mapping: Modify the char_list in get_char_for_number if additional characters are needed.

Troubleshooting

 • Invalid Folder Path: Ensure the folder path entered is correct and contains the expected image files.
 • Failed to Load Image: Check if the images are accessible and correctly named.
